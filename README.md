# Building a Data-Driven Income Statement Dashboard in Power BI

## Table Of Content

### Project Overview
Creating a compelling data visualization is more than just arranging numbers on a screen; it's about telling a story that drives insight and action. In this project, I developed an income statement dashboard for a fictional organization, capturing its financial performance over the past two years. Below, I'll walk you through the key stages of this project, from data preparation to the final design, showcasing how tools like Power BI, DAX, and effective dashboard design can be leveraged to create impactful data stories.

### Extract, Tranform, Load (ETL)
The first step in building this dashboard involved gathering and transforming the necessary financial data. The data was sourced from various financial records, including revenue streams, costs, expenses, and taxes. Using Power BI's Power Query Editor, I performed several transformations to ensure the data was clean and structured correctly.

### Key steps in the ETL process:

- Extraction: Financial data from multiple sources were imported into Power BI.
- Transformation: This involved cleaning the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in data types. Calculated columns were created to derive necessary metrics such as Net Income and EBIT.
- Loading: Once transformed, the data was loaded into Power BIâ€™s data model, ready for further analysis.
